    <div id="letter">
        I have just received word that our home town was attacked yesterday, February 17, 1940. Please, Lord do tell me that you have escaped trouble. I do not even know if this letter has reached you. I will do my best to get to you. We are currently entrenched and the situation here has become dire as well. We are all but surrounded. Why did all this have to happen.<br><br>
        Nevertheless, I will get to you as soon as I can, dessertation be damned. Please when I do arrive, be hiding do not be seen with those neighbors of ours, it will spell the death of you. You and I know very well what the Germans do, and losing you is not something I had planned when I had left. I know it will be hard, but these times are troubling and we will have to do what we need to in order to survive.<br><br>
        I will be heading there as soon as I can, please stay safe.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align:right" id="header">Your love until the end, <br> Chompre Saint-Luxi√©re
