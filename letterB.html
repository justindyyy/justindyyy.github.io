        Mon Chéri,
    </div>
    <div id="letter">
        I send this letter in a manner of urgency. I cannot wait for your message to arrive as there has been word spreading that our village will be next in the attack. In the first hour the next day, I will join other army men aboard a train to the next city, and the city after that. Consequently, I may not be able to send another letter until a few more weeks. <br><br>
        I cannot stress enough how much I will be thinking about you over the following weeks. Life here for the past 6 months has become dull and uninteresting. You've always had a way with words, turning daily chores into colorful stories. However, things here have become so dire. Gangs of teens began making rackets throughout the village. Constant theft and crime is not such commonplace that it is no longer safe for me to stay. <br><br>
        Neverhteless, I will be making sure to send you more letters once I arrive where it is safe. I will bring along with me the children from the Goldstein family next-door, God forbid what they will do to these kids. What would you prefer? A flask of Amontillado perhaps? I remember you say that the chocolate arrived spoiled, I will make sure that doesnt happen again.<br><br>
