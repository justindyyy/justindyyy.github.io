    <div id="letter">
        I can't believe I have been stationed here for half of a year now, half a year away from you.<br><br>
        I have recently been posted to a site a few kilometers to the east of the border of France. It's quite lovely here, I hope that once all this settles down, we move here. The sun shines a golden ray here, while the flowers emit a gentle yet pronounced scent. This place reminds me of the life we have always wanted to live. Mellow yet happy, blissful yet calming. <br><br>
        Your previous letter to me dated February 5,1940 mentioned about your desire to work for the government for a while. I've been entertaining the thought, kind of hard to do when you're constantly wary of what might come next. I think it would be the perfect job for you as well, it may remedy your feeling of ineptness. I do hope that you are careful, though. Antoine says that the job is filled with people you cannot trust, God forbid spies from our enemies. <br><br>
        
        Apeaking of Antoine, we've gotten a lot closer since when we were first posted together. Once this is all over, we've been talking over having a picnic together under the Tuscan sun, that is if Italy becomes an ally once more. I have met a lot of other people here as of today, and some of them unfortunately has passed already. I do hope that this becomes over soon.
